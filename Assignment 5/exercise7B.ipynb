PCA consists of two computational steps: \n\n1. Compute the covariance matrix of the data.\n2. Use SVD (in python we use numpy's implementation `np.linalg.svd`) to compute the eigenvectors $U_1$, $U_2$, $\\dots$, $U_n$. These will correspond to the principal components of variation in the data.\n\nFirst, you should compute the covariance matrix of the data, which is given by:\n\n$$ \\Sigma = \\frac{1}{m} X^T X$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the data matrix with examples in rows, and $m$ is the number of examples. Note that $\\Sigma$ is a $n \\times n$ matrix and not the summation operator. \n\nAfter computing the covariance matrix, you can run SVD on it to compute the principal components. In python and `numpy` (or `scipy`), you can run SVD with the following command: `U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(Sigma)`, where `U` will contain the principal components and `S` will contain a diagonal matrix. Note that the `scipy` library also has a similar function to compute SVD `scipy.linalg.svd`. The functions in the two libraries use the same C-based library (LAPACK) for the SVD computation, but the `scipy` version provides more options and arguments to control SVD computation. In this exercise, we will stick with the `numpy` implementation of SVD.\n\nComplete the code in the following cell to implemente PCA.\n<a id=\"pca\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def pca(X):\n    \"\"\"\n    Run principal component analysis.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    X : array_like\n        The dataset to be used for computing PCA.
